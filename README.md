# ASTR260_HW11

Problem 1: 

Part A - run AidanWalk_HW11_1a by executing python AidanWalk_HW11_1a.py. This will save a .png file titled AidanWalk_HW11_1a_Plot to the local directory. This plot was generated using Poisson's equation. The runtime (with numba implimentation) will print in the terminal.

Part B - run AidanWalk_HW11_1b by executing python AidanWalk_HW11_1b.py. This will save a .png file titled AidanWalk_HW11_1b_Plot to the local directory. This plot was generated using Gauss-Seidel Method. The runtime (with numba implimentation) will print in the terminal.

Problem 2:

run AidanWalk_HW11_2a by executing python AidanWalk_HW11_2a.py This will display a plot at t = 0 of my 'piano string'. I am not implimenting this correclty at all, but the program does generate a wave shape!
